2019 Draft Prep Outline

* Intro, typical strategy *
	get some bats, maybe an ace, waiver wire some two-starters and get good ratios, HLDs, and maybe some saves with relievers
	league settings - team makeup and categories (note which ones have projections)
Get position eligibility data (Yahoo)
Get Depth Charts projection data (Fangraphs export)
Join data sets (resolve join errors)
* Display initial data sets *
	Both - playerid, Name, team, ADP
	Pitchers - IP, SV:ERA, SO, WHIP
	Batters - PA, H, HR:SO, SB, OBP, OPS
generate z score rankings (move to separate function)
	weigh pitchers with double multipier for ERA and WHIP to counteract several categories without projections
* Visual: compare ADP vs rank via z_score, or z_score directly *
	note the types of players more and less valuable than ADP
* Visual - same plot faceted by position *
	note the positions with scarcity, high/low value, etc
* Visual - boxplot style of z_sum, with position factors *
	ideally some identifier for median/replacement level/6th or 12th best
Compare draft strategies
	best z_sum available staying within positional requirements (bench last? exclude bench?)
	best z_sum available considering ADP, position scarcity
	measure trade offs by taking lower z_sums in scare positions vs going for high z_sum
	simulate other teams based on ADP
	compute projected team stats, compare z_sums
	determine what a "replacement-level" player is
* Visual - plot results of each strategy * 
Build player tiers, draft-day document based on results
	exclude known keepers
